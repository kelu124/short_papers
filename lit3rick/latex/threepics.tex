On the first image, note the water bag for acoustic matching. On the last image, the tube holding the focused transducer ad a fairly narrow beam and a broad bandwidth signal response which allowed for high axial and lateral resolution. The transducer head could be in moved linearly back and forth or it could oscillate back in a polar rotation over about 120 degree angle, allowing visualization of biological structures that where in the field of view of the sound beam.
